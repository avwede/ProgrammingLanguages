In this round, I answered 1 question.

## Question #1 - Judging Delay 

:hammer: https://www.codechef.com/LTIME64B/problems/JDELAY

I used 2 for loops to solve the problem; the first loop tracks the number of test cases and the second reads each line that follows.
I set up a counter to increment by 1 each time the delay is greater than 5 minutes, and at the end of the for loops, I set the counter back to 0 to account for multiple test cases.

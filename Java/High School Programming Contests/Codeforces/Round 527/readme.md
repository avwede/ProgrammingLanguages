# Codeforces Round #525
In this round, I answered 2 problems.

## Question #1 - Uniform String
https://codeforces.com/contest/1092/problem/A

I solved this problem using a single for loop, which printed each character incrementing as i modulus k.

## Question #2 - Teams Forming
https://codeforces.com/contest/1092/problem/B

To solve this problem, I scanned each value into an array. I then sorted the array, using a for loop to increment by 2 and form teams while also adding to my count with the difference of the values of each team.

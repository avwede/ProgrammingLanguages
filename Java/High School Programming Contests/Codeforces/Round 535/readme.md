# Codeforces Round #535
In this round, I answered 2 problems.

## Question #1 - Two Distinct Points
http://codeforces.com/contest/1108/problem/A

I solved this problem by simply scanning in each integer, comparing a and c, and then adding one to a if they were equal. 

## Question #2 - Divisors of Two Integers
http://codeforces.com/contest/1108/problem/B

To solve this problem, I scanned each value into an array and then sorted it, taking the largest integer as the first answer. 
To find the second answer, I used a boolean array and then found the largest integer that was not divisible by the first answer.

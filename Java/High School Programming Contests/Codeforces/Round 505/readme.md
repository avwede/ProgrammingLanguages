## Question #1 - Doggo Recoloring 
:dog: https://codeforces.com/contest/1025/problem/A

I used logical reasoning for this problem to determine if it is possible to standardize all of the dogs. The logic is actually quite simple; if a character is repeated at least twice (letterCounts>1), then the sequence of characters can be standardized to one.

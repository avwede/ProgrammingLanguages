# Codeforces Mali.Ru Cup Round 2

In this round, I answered 1 question.

## Question #1 - Metro

:metro: https://codeforces.com/contest/1055/problem/A

I solved 1 problem using simple for loops, if else statements, and arrays. My code walks through the first array, determining if Bob can travel using just the first track. If this is not possible, my code then uses a for loop to determine if Bob can switch tracks (this can only occur if both integers in the same position are = 1), and then determines if Bob can travel to Alice's house on the second track.

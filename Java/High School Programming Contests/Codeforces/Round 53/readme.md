# Codeforces Round #53

In this round, I answered 1 question.

## Question #1 - Diverse Substring 

http://codeforces.com/contest/1073/problem/A

To check if the substring is diverse, I used an if statement and a for loop. The for loop checks the first 2 characters of the string, printing YES if they are not equal to eachother (and therefore diverse). The if statement accounts for a string of 1 character, automatically printing NO if this is true (and therefore not diverse).

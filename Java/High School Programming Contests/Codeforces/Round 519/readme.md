I solved 1 problem using arrays, for loops, and while loops. I learned how to declare an array of integers and sort it to find the highest value. I then used the highest value to run through the loop and compare Awruk's total votes to Elodreip's total. If Awruk was less than Elodreip, I added one to the highest value, and ran through the loop again until Awruk was greater.

# Florida High School Programming Series Round #2 
:wolf: Team Lone Wolf (Ashley & Addison) - 12/6/18 

In this round, we solved 2 problems. 

## Question #1 - Learn to Dance 

:dancers: To solve this problem, we looped through the input to see if the current character is equal to the next. Finding the number of characters that were the same was the answer. 

## Question 2: Flipper-McFlopper

:hamburger: To solve this problem, we took the last digit of the input and found the most efficient way to get that number to 7. We used the rule that when multiplying by 11, the last digit will stay the same.
